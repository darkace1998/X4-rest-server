## Quick Start

### For Single Player REST API
1. Install the DLL into your X4 directory
2. Start X4 Foundations
3. Access the REST API at `http://localhost:3002`

### For Enhanced Multiplayer Coordination

#### Running a Dedicated Server with Full Features
1. Create/edit `multiplayer_config.json`:
```json
{
    "configVersion": "2.0.0",
    "server": {
        "enableDedicatedServer": true,
        "serverPort": 3003,
        "wsPort": 3004,
        "serverName": "My Enhanced X4 Server",
        "enableAuthentication": true,
        "enableTLS": false,
        "enableEventNotifications": true,
        "enableDetailedEconomySync": true,
        "enableAdminInterface": true
    }
}
```
2. Start X4 with the enhanced mod
3. Coordination server runs on port 3003
4. WebSocket events on port 3004
5. Admin interface at `http://localhost:3002/admin/dashboard`

#### Connecting as Authenticated Client
1. Register user account: `POST /auth/register`
2. Login to get token: `POST /auth/login`
3. Configure client with authentication:
```json
{
    "client": {
        "enableMultiplayer": true,
        "serverHost": "server-ip-address",
        "serverPort": 3003,
        "useAuthentication": true,
        "username": "your_username",
        "enableEventNotifications": true,
        "enableDetailedEconomySync": true
    }
}
```
