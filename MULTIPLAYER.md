# X4 Foundations Enhanced Multiplayer Functionality

This document describes the comprehensive multiplayer coordination system for X4 Foundations, featuring full authentication, encrypted communication, detailed economy synchronization, event notifications, and web-based administration.

## Overview

The enhanced multiplayer system provides a complete coordination platform for multiple X4 Foundations instances. This is **not** true multiplayer gameplay - each player still runs their own single-player X4 game, but they can now securely authenticate, share detailed information, receive real-time notifications, and administrators can manage the coordination server through a web interface.

## Architecture

### Components

1. **Multiplayer Server** (`MultiplayerServer.h/cpp`)
   - Dedicated coordination server that manages multiple player sessions
   - Handles player join/leave, heartbeats, and data synchronization
   - Provides chat functionality and shared universe state

2. **Multiplayer Client** (`MultiplayerClient.h/cpp`)
   - Client component that connects to the coordination server
   - Synchronizes local player data with the server
   - Retrieves information about other players

3. **Multiplayer Configuration** (`MultiplayerConfig.h/cpp`)
   - Configuration management for both server and client modes
   - JSON-based configuration with sensible defaults

4. **REST API Extensions** (`multiplayer_funcs.h`)
   - New HTTP endpoints for multiplayer functionality
   - Integration with existing X4 REST API

## Setup

### Running as Dedicated Server

1. Set `"enableDedicatedServer": true` in the server configuration
2. Configure the server port and settings
3. Start X4 with the modified DLL
4. The coordination server will start automatically

### Running as Client

1. Set `"enableMultiplayer": true` in the client configuration
2. Configure the server host and port to point to your coordination server
3. Set your player name
4. Start X4 with the modified DLL
5. Use the API endpoints to connect to the server

```

## Limitations

- This is not true multiplayer - each player runs their own X4 instance
- No direct game world interaction between players
- Limited to information sharing and coordination
- Requires all players to have the modified DLL installed
- Network latency may affect synchronization timing

## Security Considerations

### Authentication & Authorization
- Strong password requirements (minimum 6 characters)
- Token-based authentication with configurable expiration
- Permission levels for different access controls
- Failed login attempt protection and account lockout
- Secure password hashing with salts

### Network Security
- Optional TLS/HTTPS encryption for all communications
- WebSocket secure connections (WSS) support
- Certificate validation for client connections
- Configurable security policies

### Data Protection
- Authentication tokens automatically expire
- User data encrypted at rest (when saved to files)
- Secure session management
- Admin interface access controls

### Recommended Security Practices
- Use TLS/HTTPS in production environments
- Regularly update authentication tokens
- Monitor failed login attempts
- Use strong passwords and unique usernames
- Limit admin access to trusted users only
- Run server behind firewall with specific port access
